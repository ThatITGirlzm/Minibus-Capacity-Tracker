🚌 Minibus Capacity Tracker

A simple JavaScript web app that tracks the number of passengers on a minibus and prevents overloading by enforcing a maximum capacity. The app updates passenger count, seat availability, and vehicle status in real time.

This project is inspired by the Scrimba passenger counter but customized for local public transport use.

✨ Features

➕ Count passengers boarding the minibus

➖ Remove passengers when they get off

🚦 Automatically shows BUS FULL when capacity is reached

🪑 Displays remaining available seats

🔄 Reset button to start a new trip
📱 Clean, mobile-friendly UI

🛠 Built With

HTML – structure

CSS – styling and layout

Vanilla JavaScript – logic and interactivity

🚀 How It Works

1. Click “Board Passenger” to add a passenger

2. Click “Passenger Alighted” to remove a passenger

3. When the passenger count reaches capacity, the status changes to BUS FULL

4. Click “Start New Trip” to reset the counter
🎯 Project Motivation

Public minibuses often exceed capacity. This app demonstrates how simple web technologies can be used to enforce limits, improve safety, and track usage in a real-world context.

It also serves as a learning project to practice:

-DOM manipulation

-Event handling

-State management in JavaScript
